# hotspot-drop

Share files insecurely without an internet connection between devices: one device hosts an HTTP server and a hotspot, and the other device connects to it.
I sometimes want to share files between devices, but Nearby/Quick Share doesn't work sometimes, and AirDrop doesn't work at all.
